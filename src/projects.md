This is a selection of personal projects I've created that I'm particularly
proud of.

[Nyom](http://nyom.app)
-----------------------

Nyom is a weekly meal planner app, and is probably the most polished
side-project I've developed. It started out as a single HTML file using Vue with
hard-coded recipes, and gradually developed into a full-featured PWA that my
partner and I use every week. I'm notably pleased with the design, which,
although basic, was implemented from scratch. This is also the largest personal
project I've worked on using JavaScript.

[dpnd](https://github.com/eZanmoto/dpnd)
----------------------------------------

`dpnd` is a tool for pulling project dependencies in a language-agnostic way. In
various projects I found myself downloading scripts and other dependencies using
a repetitive pattern of `git clone` and `git checkout`, so I abstracted the
process.
