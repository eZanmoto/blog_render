My name is Se√°n Kelleher, I'm a software engineer, and I'm the CTO at
[Trustap](https://trustap.com).

I'm passionate about code stability. To this end I've spent time learning and
researching things like type theory, virtualisation and containerisation, proper
error handling, isolated testing, Rust's borrow checker, and other topics. I see
error handling in particular as a major shortcoming and source of instability in
a lot of modern software and it's something that I hope to write more about.

Early on in my programming journey I explored different programming languages in
a conscious effort to find my ideal language. This was largely influenced by an
early mentor of mine in college, the late Joseph Manning. The result of this
research is that Go is the language I rely on for practical use, but Rust is
probably the closest to what my ideal programming language would be. I've also
implemented a few compilers and interpreters, but mostly for learning purposes.

Other areas of Computer Science that I've spent considerable time on, but don't
focus on as much anymore outside of work, are security, game development, and
Operating Systems.

I have a number of hobbies outside of computers, but I tend to go through bouts
of energy with each.
